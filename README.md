# today-i-learned

This is a silly repo that contains public examples and explanations of things that im learning in my daily routine as a developer, that i usually stash away in a notes app, to myself on slack, or yap to my friends and family.

Some of these will be turning into articles, most of them are for my own reference for later.

Enjoy!
